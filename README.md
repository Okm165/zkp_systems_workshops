# Zero-Knowledge Proof systems: A Deep Dive from Foundations to Frontiers

Welcome to a comprehensive course on the theory and practice of modern Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) systems. This repository contains a series of lectures designed to deconstruct the complex world of ZKPs, starting from the mathematical first principles and building up to the architectural design of state-of-the-art systems.

## Course Lectures

The course is structured as a series of chapters, each building on the last.

*   ### [Chapter 1: The Architecture of a Zero-Knowledge Proof System](./0_zkp_architecture/README.md)
    *   **Description:** This chapter introduces the "big picture" of a modern ZKP system. We define the axiomatic guarantees of a proof system (Completeness, Soundness, Zero-Knowledge) and present the powerful architectural framework that separates the logic layer (PIOPs) from the cryptographic layer (PCSs).

*   ### [Chapter 2: The Mathematical Toolkit for Verifiable Computation](./1_mathematical_toolkit/README.md)
    *   **Description:** Here, we establish the three mathematical pillars of ZKPs: Finite Fields for perfect arithmetic, Polynomials for encoding computational logic (Arithmetization), and Cryptographic Hash Functions for building transparent and non-interactive systems.
